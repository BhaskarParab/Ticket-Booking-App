# TICKET BOOKING APP (CLI)

This is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Ticket Booking App built in Java with Gradle as the build tool. The project serves as a learning and practice platform to deepen understanding of object-oriented programming, Java collections, file handling, modular code structure, and user input management.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world train ticket booking system entirely via the terminal, allowing you to practice core Java concepts and command-line application development.

This project acts as a personal playground to experiment with essential backend and Java skills such as:

Designing reusable classes and methods

Handling user input and validations

Managing collections and data structures efficiently

Reading and writing data using files

Implementing business logic like train selection, ticket booking, and history tracking

Structuring a scalable Java project with Gradle

Testing and debugging in a CLI environment

## Getting Started
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BhaskarParab/Ticket-Booking-App.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd Ticket-Booking-App
```

### Step 3: Build and Run the App

Using Gradle wrapper:
```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```

Or, if Gradle is installed globally:
```bash
gradle build
gradle run
```

### Step 4: Using the App

Once the application starts, you can:

View Available Trains – List all trains with their stations and timings.

Book Tickets – Select a train and book tickets for passengers.

View Booking History – Check your booked tickets.

Cancel Tickets – Remove a booking if needed.

Exit – Quit the application.

All data is stored in memory, simulating a simple ticket booking flow.

## Project Features

Train Management – Add, view, and manage trains and stations.

Ticket Booking – Input passenger details, select seats, and generate bookings.

Booking History – Keep track of all booked tickets.

Data Storage – Optional: Extend to save/load data from files for persistence.

CLI User Interface – Simple and clean command-line interactions.
